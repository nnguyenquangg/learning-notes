# Transactions Across Microservices

1. Understanding Transactions and ACID Principles:

`Transactions, in the context of microservices, represent a fundamental mechanism for ensuring data consistency and reliability across distributed systems. At the core of transactional integrity lie the ACID principles: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These principles serve as the bedrock for maintaining data integrity in traditional database systems.`


2. Comparing between Monolithic architectures and Microservice architectures

## Handling Transactions: Monolithic vs. Microservices Architectures

| Aspect                   | Monolithic Architectures                                     | Microservices Architectures                                |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Database Transactions**| - Managed within a single database instance.<br>- Utilizes transactional SQL commands like BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK. | - Spans multiple databases owned by different services.<br>- Requires additional mechanisms like two-phase commit protocols or compensating transactions. |
| **ACID Compliance**      | - Ensures ACID compliance within a single database instance.<br>- Adheres to Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability principles. | - Achieving full ACID compliance is challenging due to the distributed nature.<br>- Often prioritizes eventual consistency over strict ACID compliance for scalability and performance. |
| **Transactional Boundaries** | - Well-defined within monolithic applications.<br>- All database operations associated with a transaction are executed within the same application context. | - More fluid, often spanning multiple services.<br>- Requires careful design of transaction boundaries and mechanisms for transactional consistency. |
| **Error Handling and Rollbacks** | - Straightforward error handling and rollbacks.<br>- Entire transaction can be rolled back in case of an error to maintain data consistency. | - Complex error handling and rollbacks, especially in distributed transactions.<br>- Requires compensating transactions or rollback strategies to undo partial changes made by failed transactions and maintain data integrity. |

In summary, while both monolithic and microservices architectures handle transactions to ensure data consistency and reliability, there are significant differences in their approaches:
- **Monolithic architectures** offer simplicity and centralized control over transactions within a single database instance, with strict adherence to ACID principles and well-defined transactional boundaries.
- **Microservices architectures** introduce challenges in coordinating distributed transactions across multiple services and databases, prioritizing eventual consistency and requiring robust error handling and rollback strategies to maintain data integrity.
