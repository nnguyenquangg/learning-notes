Optimize Queries: Start by identifying and optimizing the queries that are responsible for high CPU usage. Use the PostgreSQL EXPLAIN statement to analyze query plans and identify which queries are the most CPU-intensive. Once you identify them, consider rewriting or optimizing those queries to be more efficient.

Indexing: Ensure that your tables are properly indexed. Lack of appropriate indexes can lead to full table scans and increased CPU usage. Review your query execution plans to determine if indexes are being utilized effectively.

Connection Pooling: Implement a connection pooling mechanism if you haven't already. This will help manage connections efficiently and prevent unnecessary CPU overhead from opening and closing connections for each query.

Resource Allocation: Check if your server has enough CPU resources to handle the load. Consider upgrading your server's CPU or using a more powerful machine if necessary.

Tune PostgreSQL Configuration: Review your PostgreSQL configuration settings and make adjustments to better utilize your server's CPU resources. Key parameters to look at include max_connections, effective_cache_size, work_mem, and maintenance_work_mem.

Parallel Query Execution: PostgreSQL can benefit from parallel query execution, especially on multi-core CPUs. You can enable parallel query execution by adjusting the max_parallel_workers and max_parallel_workers_per_gather settings.

Monitoring: Use monitoring tools to track CPU usage and identify which queries or processes are consuming the most CPU resources. Tools like pg_stat_statements and pg_stat_activity can help you monitor and diagnose CPU-intensive queries.

Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the number of repetitive queries hitting the database, which can help lower CPU usage.

Review Extensions and Background Processes: Check if any PostgreSQL extensions or background processes are contributing to high CPU usage. Some extensions or background jobs can consume significant CPU resources.

Regular Maintenance: Ensure that you perform regular maintenance tasks such as vacuuming and analyzing the database to keep it healthy and prevent bloat.

Consider Hardware Upgrades: If your CPU usage remains consistently high despite optimizations, consider upgrading to a more powerful server with additional CPU cores and faster clock speeds.

Load Balancing: If your workload can be distributed across multiple PostgreSQL instances, consider implementing load balancing to spread the CPU load.
